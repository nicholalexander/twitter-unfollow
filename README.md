# twitter-unfollow

Forked from https://github.com/KrauseFx/twitter-unfollow with a few special modifications.


## Using

- Create your application via [Twitter Apps](https://apps.twitter.com)
- Set the following environment variables
  - `ENV["CONSUMER_KEY"]`
  - `ENV["CONSUMER_SECRET"]`
  - `ENV["ACCESS_TOKEN"]`
  - `ENV["ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"]`
- Due to the API limits this script can only unfollow about 420 people per run. You'll need to regenerate keys after this ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
